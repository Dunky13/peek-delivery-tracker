-- The carrier dashboard's goals: few errors a reader sees, good tracking, and parcels
-- answered by their carrier's own tracking rather than a universal provider (17TRACK,
-- ParcelsApp, Ship24, Postal Ninja, UPU). See docs/OBSERVABILITY.md.
--
-- private.tracking_gaps classifies each unfinished parcel that a provider tracks or
-- whose checks fail: the carrier that could take it, why it does not, and the lane that
-- acts on it. The hourly review (ops/review/signals.sql) lists it with number shapes;
-- metrics.carrier_gaps counts it by carrier for Grafana.
--
-- metrics.goals_daily keeps one row per UTC day, rewritten by record_usage_metrics at most
-- every ten minutes, and once more after midnight as of the day's end. The past days the
-- checks' audit still holds are filled from it below.
--
-- metrics.releases lists each server version's start, for the dashboard's annotations.
--
-- Nothing here names a parcel, an account or a number outside the private schema. The
-- server needs no change: it already calls record_usage_metrics.
