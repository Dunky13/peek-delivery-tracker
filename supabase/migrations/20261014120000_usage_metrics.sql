-- Counts of accounts and parcels for the usage dashboard in Grafana.
--
-- Grafana reads the metrics schema as metrics_reader, which can read nothing else. The
-- schema holds counts only: nothing in it names an account, a parcel or a number, and
-- PostgREST does not serve it. Production gives metrics_reader LOGIN and a password
-- outside the repository.
--
-- metrics.daily keeps one row per UTC day. The maintenance pass after each scheduled sync
-- rewrites today's row, and the additions of the day before, whose last hour the day's
-- last pass may not have seen. Accounts and parcels being tracked are what the day's
-- last pass counted.
--
-- metrics.active_accounts counts the accounts that opened their deliveries in each UTC
-- day, week (from Monday) and month: record_account_opened counts an account when its
-- last_opened_at moves into a period it was not in yet.
--
-- Past days are filled from what is stored now, so accounts and parcels deleted since
-- are missing from them, and a parcel counts as tracked until its delivery or return was
-- stored, or it was archived. Past activity comes from sign-ins and session renewals in
-- the Auth audit log; the current day, week and month from the recorded openings.
--
-- Apply this before deploying the server that calls record_usage_metrics. The server
-- before it keeps working: record_account_opened keeps its signature.
